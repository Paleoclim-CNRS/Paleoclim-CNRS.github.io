# Download & Compile the code 

Instructions : https://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/igcmg_doc/wiki/DocHconfigAipslcm5a2

First you have to choose the version of the model you want to install : 

•	Standard version  (ORCA grid - e.g. Modern simulations)

•	Paleo version (PALEORCA)

Both can be run without ice, which requires additional changes in the code before compilation
