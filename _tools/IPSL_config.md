# Download & Compile the code 

_Additional documentation can be found [here](https://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/igcmg_doc/wiki/DocHconfigAipslcm5a2)_

_First you have to choose the version of the model you want to install :_
- _Standard version  (ORCA grid - e.g. Modern simulations)_
- _Paleo version (PALEORCA)_

_Both can be run without ice, which requires additional changes in the code before compilation_
