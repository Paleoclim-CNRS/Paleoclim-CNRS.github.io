There are several ways to install python, but in this documentation we will use the **Anaconda Distribution** platform because it contains various convenient tools to install and configure python quickly.

## 1 - Install Anaconda

Start by downloading the installer relative to your operating system on the [Anaconda official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

Once it is done, install it.

When installation is done, launch **Anaconda-Navigator** 

![Anaconda-Navigator](/assets/images/Anaconda-Navigator.png)


You will see a graphical interface looking like this:

![Anaconda-Navigator menu](/assets/images/Anaconda-Navigator_menu.png)

From this interface, you will be able to manage many aspects like the python packages that you've installed for example.

## 2 - Choice of an IDE

At this stage, in order to use python you can simply launch an interpreter from your terminal (by using the command `python`) or use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which will generally come with a number of tools and functionnalities designed to help coding.

Among the popular ones, we can list **Spyder**, **PyCharm**, **Jupyter**, **VS Code**...

They all have pros and cons relative to each other making them suitable for various tasks. 

In this tutorial, we will use **Spyder** because it already comes with the **Anaconda Distribution** and has a nice and intuitive interface.

## 3 - Create Conda environnement

When you install Anaconda, a python environnement is set on your computer called **base**. This **base** environment contains a version of python and some other basic packages. At this step you can simply launch **Spyder** from the **Anaconda-Navigator** graphical interface and start coding.

But over time, you will probably need to install python packages that will allow you to perform other tasks.
When it comes to that, it is generally of good practice to create a new environment so the base environment is not altered (See section below to [install python packages](#5---install-python-packages)).
Creating a new environnement can be useful to avoid compatibility issues between packages or to use python tools with specific packages requirements for example.

In order to create this new environnement you can proceed by using the graphical interface or the terminal.

- With the graphical interface:

  1. Select the **Environments** tab
  1. Clic on the "Create" icon
  1. Enter the name of the new environment, select the version of python you want and clic on "Create".

![Create env](/assets/images/Create_env.png)

- With the terminal:

  Create the new environment with a specific version of Python, using the command: 
  ```
  conda create -n env_name python=X.X
  ```

  Where:
  - `env_name` is the name of the environment you want to create
  - `X.X` is the python version

  For this tutorial we will use the **myenv** environnement name and the latest python version available as for now **3.10**.
  ```
  conda create -n myenv python=3.10
  ```

After this step, the conda environment should have generated a python executable of the version you chose in a path looking like:
```
/home/username/anaconda3/envs/myenv/bin/python
```


## 4 - Install spyder-kernels package

In order to **Spyder** to be able to use the python interpreter generated by your conda environment **myenv**, you will need to install the `spyder-kernels` package in this environment.

This package provides Jupyter kernels for use with the consoles of **Spyder**.

1. Open a terminal
1. Activate the conda environment **myenv** by using the command:
```
conda activate myenv
```
1. Install the package via the command:
```
conda install spyder-kernels=2.3
``` 

<div class="alert alert-info">
<em><b>Note</b>: you can also install packages through the <b>Anaconda-Navigator</b> graphical interface (Check section <a href="#6---install-python-packages">Install python packages</a>).</em>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<em><b>Warning</b>: currently the version required for <code>spyder-kernels</code> should be <code>>= 2.3.0</code> and <code>< 2.4.0</code>. Consider this might change later. It will get notified in the <b>Spyder</b> console. From then you will have to remove the <code>spyder-kernels</code> package currently installed on the <b>myenv</b> environment and install the version of the required one (Check <a href="#useful-commands">Useful commands</a>).</em>
</div>

## 5 - Configure Spyder

At this point, you will need to set the conda environment **myenv** as the default environment used by Spyder.
For this step, launch Spyder and clic at the bottom right of the window as showed in the figure below:

![Change env 1](/assets/images/Change_env_1.png)

Then clic on **Change default environment in Preferences**.

A window should open: 
1. Select the **Python interpreter** tab
1. Tick the *Use the following Python interpreter* box.
1. Clic on the dropdown menu
1. Select your python interpreter (If the environment has been successfully installed, it should appear)
1. Apply the changes

![Change env 2](/assets/images/Change_env_2.png)

On the figure above (box nÂ°4) you can see that beside the base environment several other environments have been installed like **pyleo**, **PANGEO**, **FERRET**, **DEV** and ***myenv***.

At this point you've selected the python interpreter from the **myenv** environment to be used as default python interpreter in Spyder's iPython console.

Now you need to have a console using this new python interpreter. For this step, either restart spyder or right clic in the console tab and select **New console (default settings)**

![New console](/assets/images/New_console.png)

A new console will appear and should be operational to start using python.


## 6 - Install python packages

Now you have successfully installed **Anaconda**, created a new environment and configured **Spyder**, you will need at some point to install new python packages in your **myenv** conda environment. 

They can be installed either through the graphical interface or the terminal.

- With the graphical interface, the step is pretty straightforward:

  1. Select the **Environments** tab
  1. Select the environment you want to install the package in
  1. Select "Not installed" in the dropdown menu
  1. Write the name of the package you want to install in the search bar
  1. Tick the box of the package
  1. Select "Apply"

![Install package](/assets/images/Install_package.png)

- With the terminal:

  1. When you know the name of the package you want to install search for the right **conda install** command on internet. For example you can write "conda numpy" in the internet research bar. Look for the official anaconda web site [here](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy) which will list the different possible commands to use.
  1. Open a terminal
  1. Activate the conda environment **myenv** by using the command:
  ```
  conda activate myenv
  ```
  1. Use one of the commands listed on the anaconda website. In our example: 
  ```
  conda install -c anaconda numpy
  ```
  <div class="alert alert-info">
  <em><b>Note</b>: we could have also used the <b>pip</b> command to install python packages but remember it is generally not advised to mix <code>pip install</code> and <code>conda install</code> in a conda environment. You can find more informations to understand pip and conda <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/blog/understanding-conda-and-pip">here</a>.</em>
  </div>

## Useful commands

Here is a list of useful commands you can use in a terminal to manage your conda environments and packages:
- List all your conda environment: 
```
conda env list
```
```
conda info --envs
```
- Create environment **myenv** with a specific python version *X.X*: 
```
conda create -n myenv python=X.X
```
- Remove environment **myenv**: 
```
conda env remove --name myenv
```
- Activate environment **myenv**: 
```
conda activate myenv
```
- Deactivate a conda environment and return in *base* environment: 
```
conda deactivate
```
- List installed packages in current environment: 
```
conda list
```
- See if a specific package *py_pack* is installed in current environment: 
```
conda list py_pack
```
- See if a specific package *py_pack* is installed in environment **myenv**: 
```
conda list -n myenv py_pack
```
- Install package *py_pack* in current environment: Look for the command on **Anaconda** website
- Remove package *py_pack* in current environment: 
```
conda remove py_pack
```

  <em><b>Note</b>: all the actions peformed by the commands above can be achieved through the graphical interface as well.</em>
