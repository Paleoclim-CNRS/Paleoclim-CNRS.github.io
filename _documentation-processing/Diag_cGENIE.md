- Set of python routines taking a cGENIE experiment directory in input, and generating a LaTeX PDF with a series of standard figures as output. 

- Python code hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/Paleoclim-CNRS/genie_basicdiags)

- Not much to add... Just type in `python basicdiag_genie_toPDF.py` to generate the PDF.

- You can change the cGENIE output directory and year plotted in the block named `USER_DEFINED OPTIONS`. More info in the script header.
