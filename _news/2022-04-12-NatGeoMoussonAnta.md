Modelers from the group in collaboration with C.Bolton, A.Licht and G.Dupont-Nivet studied the development of modern-like South Asian Monsoon
using Miocene paleoclimate simulations. Results have just been publish in [Nature Geoscience](https://rdcu.be/cKXlb ){:target="_blank"}.

They show that monsoon winds and rainfall evolved with different timing during the Neogene as they react to different paleogeographic elements
that have their own chronology. This study highlights that (often forgotten) paleogeographic changes at the western border of Indian Ocean (East Africa and Middle East) have been crucial for the settlement of the modern atmospheric circulation, while monsoon rainfall intensity mainly responds to increasing
elevation in the Himalayas region. 

Those results reconcile for the first time divergent views of monsoon evolution and shed light on mechanisms forcing the Miocene « onset » of the system.
