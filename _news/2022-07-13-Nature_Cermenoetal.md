Modern ocean biodiversity, which is at its highest level ever, was achieved through long-term stability of the location of so-called biodiversity hotspots, regions of especially high numbers of species, scientists have found.

The findings, published today in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04932-6){:target="_blank"}, were reached through a pioneering model that reconstructs the diversity of marine animals from their origin - some 550 million years ago- to the present, based on plate tectonics and environmental factors, mainly ocean temperature and food supply.
