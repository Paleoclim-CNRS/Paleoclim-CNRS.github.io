After having completed her PhD thesis at LSCE, Anta started a postdoc at CEREGE in September 2019. Anta and Yannick
got the opportunity to work with micropaleontologists at CEREGE, Luc Beaufort, Clara Bolton and Baptiste Sucheras,
and to apply Earth System model to anchor interpretations in a framework based on physics laws. Both coccoliths data 
and climate model converge toward a unified scenario pointing out the priming role of the eccentricity to lead up 
biological evolution occurring in tropical oceanic waters.
