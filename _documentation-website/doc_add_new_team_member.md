# Add the person to site authors

All the site authors are stores in `_data/authors.yml` this file holds all the information to create the author profiles in the side bar, as seen below. This only needs to be done once per person.

If you already have a GitHub account (which you should) you can edit the file online [here](https://github.com/CEREGE-CL/CEREGE-CL.github.io/edit/main/_data/authors.yml) when prompted for an avatar file, fill out the file name in advance then upload the file (with the correct filename) [here](https://github.com/CEREGE-CL/CEREGE-CL.github.io/upload/main/assets/images). <br> <br>__Make sure to scroll down to the bottom and COMMIT YOUR CHANGES__

## Example
You will find examples already in the file:

``` yaml
Wesley:
  name        : "Wesley Banfield"
  # This is how you do multilines
  bio         : >
    Research Engineer passionate 
    about bringing cutting edge 
    technology to geosciences
  avatar      : "/assets/images/wesley_banfield.png"
  location    : "Aix-en-Provence, France"
  links:
    - label: "Email"
      icon: "fas fa-fw fa-envelope-square"
      url: "mailto:banfield@cerege.fr"
    - label: "Website"
      icon: "fas fa-fw fa-link"
      url: "https://wesleythegeolien.github.io/random_raves/"
    - label: "GitHub"
      icon: "fab fa-fw fa-github"
      url: "https://github.com/wesleythegeolien"
    - label: "Twitter"
      icon: "fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square"
      url: "https://twitter.com/banfieldwesley"
    - label: "LinkedIn"
      icon: "fab fa-fw fa-linkedin"
      url: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/wesleybanfield/"
```

## Set lookup name
The first line is used to define a unique name that can be looked up, this will not be visible on the website it is only used internally, notably with `author: ` keyword in the Front Matter (Top of files).

Good practice is to use your *first name* unless there are duplicates. 

## General information
The next lines in the file is for general information.
* **name** is the name that will be shown
* **bio** a short text that talks about yourself, this is shown underneath your name in the side panel
* **location** Name of Lab or city you are in
* **avatar** this is a link to the file of your profile picture. These should be placed in `assets/images/firstname_surname.EXT`. 

It is best practice not to make the avatar files massive which will slow down the loading of webpages, a couple of Mb is more than enough.

## Links
The next part setups the links at the bottom of the panel, you can have as many as you want.
* **label** name that is shown in the sidebar
* **url** hyperlink when clicked on.
* **icon** link to an icon we use [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) which have a lot of choice. 

Leave the `fab fa-fw` at the start it specifies how we want the icon rendered (`fab` is the style and `fa-fw` is fixed width)

# Create page
Now that the author profile is setup we can start creating your webpage!

## Create file
The first step is to create a new file `firstname_surname.md` in `_team` (example: `_team/wesley_banfield.md`)

If you already have a GitHub account (which you should) you can create the file online [here](https://github.com/CEREGE-CL/CEREGE-CL.github.io/new/main/_team). <br> <br>__Make sure to scroll down to the bottom and COMMIT YOUR CHANGES__
